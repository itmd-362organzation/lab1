<h1>A little about myself</h1>
	<p>I am a proud participant in the Aspen Young Leaders Fellowship. This program has been an incredible experience for me, and I have learned so much about what it means to be a leader and how to effectively lead others.One of the most valuable things I have learned during my time in the fellowship is the importance of having a clear vision and being able to communicate that vision to others</p>
	<p> I have always been creative and artistic, and I love making wall murals. I have been working hard to develop my skills and improve my technique, and I am starting to gain recognition for my work. I have already completed a number of murals for local businesses and organizations, and I am confident that with time and effort, I will be able to make a name for myself as a talented and sought-after artist.
